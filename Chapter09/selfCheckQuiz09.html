    1. Go to your favorite website and open the browser console. Type document.body. 
    What do you see in the console? <br>
    body#www-wikipedia-org.jsl10n-visible (the full output is the body structure o fthe page)
<br><br>
    2. As we know, with objects, we can write to the property value and assign a
    new value with the assignment operator. Update the textContent property
    of the document.body object on a web page of your choosing to contain the
    string Hello World. <br>
    successfully set wikipedia body.textContent to "Wikipedia: Hello World"
<br><br>
    3. Use what we learned about objects to list out BOM object properties and
    values. Try it on the document object. <br>
    console.dir(document);
    <script>
        console.dir(document);
    </script>
<br><br>
    4. Now do the same for the window object. <br>
    console.dir(window);
    <script>
        console.dir(window);
    </script>
<br><br>
    5. Create an HTML file with an h1 tag. Use JavaScript and select the page
    element with the h1 tag and assign the element into a variable. Update the
    textContent property of the variable to Hello World.
    <h1></h1>
    <script>
        let h1 = document.querySelector("h1");
        h1.textContent = "Hello World";
    </script>
</body>
